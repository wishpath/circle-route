problems:
  - GpxFilesProcessorAndEvaluator logging to console is off: filenames
  - filter routes by proximity to a given center and length point and make separate dir with copies that match
  - unify all routes by going clockwise and starting on the north
  - merge LithuaniaTraverser and CitiesTraverser?
  - add more town centers so finding closest city would be more precise
  - why no routes with intended length of 40km?
  - for (; loopStartPoint < routedPoints.size(); loopStartPoint++) { //for efficiency move by some distance, like at least 50 meters
  - //do i need both to snap and route? or this can be done in one?
  - improve traversing lithuania speed: isWithinPolygon is processing the same thing over and over currently
  - double idealAreaKm = round2(GeoUtils.getCircleAreaByLength(routeLength)); // precalculate this and store to a map
  - loop profiles "foot", motorcycle and so on
  - sliding efficiency window:
    - try "gravel bike" profile, try rerouting to opposite direction

get maps:
  - find map of lithuania here:
    - https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html
      - unarchive an place in src/main/java/org/sa/map_data
  - small portions of map, smaller than Lithuania:
    - https://garmin.bbbike.org/
  - large files like "europe" 30gb:
    - https://download.geofabrik.de/


map format:
  - .osm
