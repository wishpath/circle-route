problems:
  - in filter: do no include route if it is within intvl routes. (95% of point are within polygon)

get maps:
  - find map of lithuania here:
    - https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html
      - unarchive an place in src/main/java/org/sa/map_data
  - small portions of map, smaller than Lithuania:
    - https://garmin.bbbike.org/
  - large files like "europe" 30gb:
    - https://download.geofabrik.de/

map format:
  - .osm

maybe later:
  - better route finding efficiency:
    - do not apply all algorithm cycles all at once:
        - only if route passes a certain threshold of efficiency:
            - apply new improvement iteration
            - increment efficiency threshold

let's not:
  - precalculate and store to memory idealAreaKm. Because this is insignificant calculation - only ads noise to code and imprecision
  - merge LithuaniaTraverser and CitiesTraverser. Because each have separate function - LithuaniaTraverser - searches for new routes. CitiesTraverser displays town data and is good for quick tests.
