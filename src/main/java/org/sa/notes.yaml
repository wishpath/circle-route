problems:
  - shift not 50% %50 ab, but each time by 25% (this can change course direction as well in the same step)
  - can force turn on highway to required directions
  - calculate area
  - sliding efficiency window:
    - start small like 100m and increment up to 25percent of route. by 100m step
      - slide this window through all route
        - retroute start and end of this window
          - if rerouting would impact course efficiency positively - keep the new routing. get a new window after injected part.
          - else keep sliding
